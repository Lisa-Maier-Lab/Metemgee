# Metemgee

Jacobo de la Cuesta-Zuluaga. August 2024.

`Metemgee` is the workflow for the obtention of taxonomic and
functional profiles of the Maier Lab. For functional profiles,
it implements the `nf-core` pipeline `taxprofiler` available
[here](https://nf-co.re/taxprofiler). For functional profiling,
it uses `mifaser`, found [here](https://bitbucket.org/bromberglab/mifaser).

The notebooks walk you through the download of the software, the
creation of files and the execution of the pipelines.

## Execution
To execute the notebooks, you will need to be able to open and
run jupyter notebooks. This can be done through a stand alone
installation or through VSCode. In addition, you will require
the ability to create `conda` environments.

The notebooks assume that you are executing the code and the
pipelines on the M3 HPC.

## Why `Metemgee`?
I was trying to come up with a clever name for this repo and it
proved harder than I thought. Googling around I accidentaly found
this Guyanese dish called _metemgee_, made of cassava, sweet potatoes
and plantains, cooked in seasoned coconut milk. I haven't tried
it yet, but it sounds so so good. Besides, 'metemgee' kinda sounds
like 'meta-g', so I'm going with that.
